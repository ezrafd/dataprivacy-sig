          <h2 style="color:black"> Why Consumers Should Be Informed of Their Data</h2>
          <p style="color:black" >
            We strongly believe that it is important for consumers to be informed of the way their data is collected online. This should be the case whether their data is collected from governmental entities, or from companies.
          </p>
            <h3 style="color:black"> Healthcare and the Right of Access</h3>
              <p style="color:black" >
                An example of this important concept is the EU’s right of access, which allows individuals to gain access to a copy of their data that has been stored by a company whose services the user has engaged with. This allows the user to and understand what data has been gathered, what their data is being used for and how it is being stored.
            </p>
            <p style="color:black">
              In the United States, the right of access to health information is guaranteed under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). However, only health insurance companies, health care providers, and entities that work with them are held accountable for protecting and complying with patients’ right of access under HIPAA. In other words, there is no specific legislation that guarantees right of access for users of other companies that collect data. Nothing protects users of social media or game apps.
            </p>
            <p style="color:black">
              Without a specific law in the United States that guarantees right of access for Americans, companies that are not in the healthcare field can ignore requests by users for their personal data, as well as not inform the users on the purpose of collecting the data and who has access to that data.
            </p>
            <p style="color:black">
            If the United States were to introduce a law similar to the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), then Americans would be able to exercise their right of access.
            </p>
          <h3 style="color:black"> The Right to be informed </h3>
            <p style="color:black">
            The right to be informed gives people the right to be informed about how their data is being used.
            </p>
            <p style="color:black">
            Though companies are obliged to explain the way they use data in their terms of service, legal wording can oftentimes be unclear in terms of service. We believe companies need to take the extra mile and  provide individuals with information detailing the purposes for processing the user’s personal data, who the data collectors will share the data with,. If your data is being shared or sold to other organizations, data collectors have to tell you which organization they are giving your data to and for what purpose.
            </p>
            <p style="color:black">
            There have also been many cases of data not being disclosed to users, and these issues need to carry harsher penalties. We need a way to deal with important surveillance data being hidden from the public, whether that be from  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-baltimore-secret-surveillance/" style="color:blue"> secret police cameras spying on Baltimore</a> or from the possibility of third parties  being able track your internet activity on one device by using a users <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/02/battery-status-indicators-tracking-online" style="color:blue"> battery percentage</a>.
            </p>
          <h3 style="color:black"> Facial Recognition Data gathered from Unaware consumers </h3>
          <img src="assets/img/facial-recog.png" class="images-float-right"alt="">
            <p style="color:black">
            When consumers aren’t given the right to understand when their data is collected, unethical behaviour from companies may ensue.
            </p>
            <p style="color:black">
            In 2009, Google was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/03/google-data-harvesting-facial-recognition-people-of-color" style="color:blue">allegedly found using subcontracted workers</a> to give $5 gift cards to members of the public in order to conduct a face scan which was marketed as a “selfie game” or “survey,” disproportionately targeting vulnerable groups like the homeless, who were viewed as more likely to accept the gift card and less likely to speak to the press. The subcontractors were instructed to target people of “darker skin tones.”
            </p>
            <p style="color:black">
             A Google spokesperson claimed that they were using the face scan data to “build fairness” into the facial unlock feature for Google phones by giving the machine the faces of people of color to learn, and that they are now investigating allegations of wrongdoing. However, many critics are harshly condemning Google for their invasion of privacy and for targeting economically vulnerable groups without informed consent. Especially for groups that have been disproportionately targeted in the criminal and counter-terrorism systems (Black, Middle Eastern, South Asian, and undocumented peoples), data privacy invasion is a discriminatory violation of rights.
            </p>
            <p style="color:black">
              If there had been legislation in place to require companies to disclose the actual use of the data, participants would have been more informed and protected from Google’s data harvesting efforts. When agreeing to the face scan, participants would have had to have clearly known the purpose of why their data was being taken and the location where it would be stored, in addition to being able to access a copy of their data. Without the right to access, corporations are able to easily target, take, and harvest the data of people of color, a violation which could lead to danger to already oppressed groups in the U.S.
            </p>
          <h3 style="color:black">Precedent</h3>
            <p style="color:black">
            There are many ways to make it easier for consumers to be informed. We can look at making <a href="https://www.termsfeed.com/blog/privacy-policy-mandatory-law/" style="color:blue">privacy policies</a> more transparent. We can use Vermont’s  <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90302036/over-120-data-brokers-inch-out-of-the-shadows-under-landmark-vermont-law" style="color:blue">data broker law</a> requiring companies to register their data usage as a template. We can even implement legislation similarly to the EU GDPR’s <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-15-gdpr/" style="color:blue">right to access</a> and <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/issues/right-to-be-informed/" style="color:blue">right to be informed</a>.
            </p>
          <h3 style="color:black"> Why is This Important? </h3>
          <p style="color:black">
          We live in a world inued by information, and it is difficult to sort out the noise and understand what is important. Companies cannot be allowed to mislead customers, whether it be deceiving them about the way their data is being collected like Google did to collect facial recognition features, or obstructing their right to see it, like many healthcare companies. How are people supposed to hold companies accountable if they are not even able to or allowed to understand what is happening?
