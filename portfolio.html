           Why Consumers Should Have a Legal Say On Their Data</h2>
            <p style="color:black" text-align="justify">
             As much as it is important for consumers to understand how their data is used, knowledge alone does not give them the power to actually change the way things are run. There is a big difference in the say consumers and their providers have in terms of personal data. Even if the consumer has unlimited access to information, if they cannot get their complaints heard, change will not happen.
            </p>
          <h3 style="color:black" text-align="justify" > What are some instances we could use the power to contest decisions and data gathering? </h3>
            <h3 style="color:black" text-align="justify" > The right to Object/Contest </h3>
              <p style="color:black" text-align="justify">
                    An example of this can be found in the right to object/contest in the EU GDPR. This right allows the data subject to object on the processing of their personal data. In addition, they may address any complaint about the way an entity gathers data to the ICO (Information Commissioner’s Office). There are some exceptions to this, such as when data needs to be gathered for the public good. This right is a good way to start giving consumers more self-determination.
              </p>
          <h3 style="color:black" text-align="justify"> Ring Doorbells and the lack of voice of the consumers </h3>
          <img src="assets/img/ring.jpg" class="images-float-right"alt="">
            <p style="color:black" text-align="justify">
              Amazon-owned Ring,  a smart doorbell company, has been criticized for data-sharing with the police community.  Ring has partnerships with over 400 police and fire departments around the United States, allowing them access to a portal of relevant surveillance footage.
              </p>
            <p style="color:black" text-align="justify">
              Currently, Ring customers are able to opt out of sharing the data collected by their Ring Doorbells. Even with the consent of the doorbell users however, critics point out that allowing law enforcement gaining access to this  surveillance infrastructure sets up a precedent with no oversight. The Electronic Frontier Foundation put it best: “Giving police direct access to request private footage endangers communities and facilitates near-constant surveillance by local police… It also provides a way for police to access a widespread CCTV network without having to go through democratic processes or be subject to traditional oversight.”
            </p>
            <p style="color:black" text-align="justify">
             Now is the time for more robust protections to be put into place, so Ring customers have a stake in the future of the data sharing of the company, as opposed to having the voice ruled by law-enforcement and the company itself. But the data from Ring doorbells doesn’t only affect consumers, and the surveillance network that is getting set up should be able to be held accountable to everyday citizens who may be spied on by these unaccountable cameras. The right to contest data gathering gives citizens more power in the data gathering devices that will soon invade their lives.
            </p>
          <h3 style="color:black"> 23andMe and Data Sharing</h3>
          <img src="assets/img/23.jpeg" class="images-float-right"alt="">
            <p style="color:black" >
          		23andMe, an infamous DNA testing service that launched in 2007, has long been used to help customers gain insight into their genetic information. Over the past decade and a half, 23andMe has reached over 5 million users, giving the company an endless supply of health information that can be used for research (provided that the users give consent from sometimes unclear terms of service).
            </p>
            <p style="color:black">
           	 	However, many customers were unaware that 23andMe had been sharing user insights to pharmaceutical companies and allowing them full access to mine that data. Though 23andMe ensures transparency to its users, many consumers fear being too trustful. Trust toward pseudo-medical companies like 23andMe has eroded, particularly because these companies are not bound by the same obligations that medical professionals are.
            </p>
            <p style="color: black">
              Should there be more privacy protections put in place, customers would have much more say in not only how their data is being used, but also whether it is being used. Moreover, users will have the ability to revoke their consent so that the company must stop processing their data, and can contest the decision 23andMe and choose in taking advantage of their data.
            </p>
          <h3 style="color:black"> Objecting to Marketing </h3>
          <img src="assets/img/marketing.jpg" class="images-float-right"alt="">
            <p style="color:black" >
            Every day, we are bombarded with advertisements encouraging us to purchase the newest, trendiest product or even subconsciously leading us to think a certain way. While target ads can help a consumer  find a product they need, oftentimes these hyper-specific ads need to track the user’s online footprint, making them  invasive and even predatory.
            </p>

            <p style="color:black" >
            While there are options to avoid being tracked on the Internet, these are often misleading. For instance, in early 2021, a judge was shocked when he found that <a href="https://theamericangenius.com/tech-news/google-gets-sued-for-misleading-name-incognito-mode/" style="color:blue">Google’s incognito mode continued to collect user data.</a> Meanwhile <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/06/25/for-profit-colleges-aggressively-target-veterans-for-enrollment-these-democrats-want-it-to-stop/?arc404=true" style="color:blue">for-profit colleges</a> aggressively target societies most vulnerable.
            </p>

            <p style="color:black" >
            While users in the EU are able to object to the processing of personal data in relation to marketing, North American users don’t have this right -- a right that is desperately needed to protect consumers from predatory data collection in this day and age.
            </p>

          <h3 style="color:black"> Why is this important? </h3>
            <p style="color:black" >
          Online services need information to operate, whether that’s gathering data for use in AI or analytics or tailoring social media suggestions. Data collection can create a win-win situation, but only if the power is distributed equally between the collector and the data subject. Moreover, encouraging companies to address the concerns of their users results in a better run company. The companies will then have employees that understand their data collection and greatermore transparency.
