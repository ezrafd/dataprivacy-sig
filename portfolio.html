          <h2 style="color:black" text-align="justify"> Why Consumers Should Have a Legal Say On Their Data</h2>
            <p style="color:black" text-align="justify">
              As much as it is important for consumers to understand how their data is used, this does not give them the power to actually change the way things are run. There is a big difference in the say consumers and their providers have in terms of personal data. Even if the consumer has access to all the information in the world, if they cannot get their complaints heard, change cannot happen.
            </p>

          <h3 style="color:black" text-align="justify"> What are some instances we could use the power to contest decisions and data gathering? </h3>
            <h3 style="color:black" text-align="justify"> The right to Object/Contest </h3>
              <p style="color:black" text-align="justify">
                    An example of this can be found in the right to object/contest in the EU GDPR. This right allows the data subject to object on the processing of their personal data. In addition, they may address any complaint about the way an entity gathers data to the ICO. There are some exceptions to this, such as when data needs to be gathered for the public good, it is a good way to start giving consumers more self-determination.
              </p>
          <h3 style="color:black" text-align="justify"> Ring Doorbells and the lack of voice of the consumers </h3>
            <p style="color:black" text-align="justify">
              Amazon-owned Ring, is a smart doorbell company, has been criticized for its strong partnerships and data-sharing with the police community.  With partnerships with over 400 police and fire departments around the United States, allowing them access to a portal to ask for relevant surveillance footage.
              </p>

            <p style="color:black" text-align="justify">
              Though currently under the law, customers are able to opt out of sharing data from their Ring Doorbells, many critics point out that this precedent sets up surveillance infrastructure with no oversight.
            </p>
            <p style="color:black" text-align="justify">
              Now is the time for more robust protections to be put into place, so Ring customers have a stake in the future of the data sharing of the company, as opposed to having the voice ruled by law-enforcement and the company itself.
            </p>
          <h3 style="color:black"> 23andMe and data sharing</h3>
            <p style="color:black" >
           23andMe, the infamous DNA testing service that launched in 2007, has long been used to help customers gain insight into their genetic information. Over the past decade and a half, 23andMe has reached over 5 million users, giving the company an endless supply of health information that can be used for research (provided that the users give consent). 
            </p>
            <p style="color:black">
            However, many customers were unaware that 23andMe has been sharing user insights to pharmaceutical companies and allowing them full access to mine that data. Though 23andMe ensures transparency to its users, many consumers fear being too trustful, knowing that companies can easily change their terms and conditions at any time as pseudo-medical companies like 23andMe are not bound by the same obligations that other medical professionals are.
            </p>
            <p style="color: black">
              Should there be more privacy protections put in place, customers could have much more say in not only whether their data is being used, but also how it is being used. Moreover, users will have the ability to revoke their consent so that the company must stop processing their data. 
            </p>
          <h3 style="color:black"> Objecting to Marketing </h3>
            <p style="color:black" >
            Every day we are bombarded with advertisements, getting us to buy things, or think a certain way. While sometimes target ads can help oneself find something they need, oftentimes they can be invasive and even predatory.
            </p>

            <p style="color:black" >
            While it may seem that there are many ways to avoid being tracked on the internet, some options are misleading. For instance, in early 2021, a judge was “disturbed” when they found that Google’s incognito mode continued to collect user data. 
            </p>

            <p style="color:black" >
            Users in the EU are able to object to processing of personal data in relation to marketing, and this is an advantage consumers in North American desperately need.
            </p>

          <h3 style="color:black"> Why is this important? </h3>
            <p style="color:black" >
          We need information to make many services work, whether that is gathering data for use in AI or analytics, or tailoring social media suggestions. Data collection can create a win-win situation, but only if the power and the discussion is distributed equally between the collector and the data subject. Encouraging companies to address the concerns of their users also results in a better run company. They will ensure that they have employees that understand their data collection, and have more transparency.
